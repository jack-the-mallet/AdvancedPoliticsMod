there is always a movement to restore "legal protection" for women. There needs to be some way of limiting political movements to what is relevant at the time
the rights of women were not really a big point of contention in 1836
how do we model this?
have "status quo" ideologies
womens_rights_status_quo1 = {
	lawgroup_womens_rights = {
		law_no_womens_rights = neutral
		law_propertied_women = neutral
		law_women_in_the_workplace = disapprove
		law_womens_suffrage = disapprove (or maybe strongly_disapprove)
	}
}

also, leader ideologies need to be changed or axed or something. leaders have way too much power over an interest group
only reactionaries should really want to go back to the way things were completely unprompted


dedicated police force gets way too much support



Illiterate villagers don't give a shit about voting. They want lower taxes, welfare payments, and not having to pay seignorial dues and the like
	also land redistribution
