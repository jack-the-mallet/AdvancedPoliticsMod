   =20
    <p><i>On 3 October 1990 Germany achieved national unity. By virtue of a
      sovereign, conscious decision of the people, the Basic Law became the
      constitution for the whole nation. The successful democratic revoluti=
on in
      the former German Democratic Republic had achieved its goals: human
      dignity, civil rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy for the ent=
ire
      German people in a society based on the rule of law tempered by socia=
l
      justice. </i></p>
   =20
    <p><i>We overcame the division of Germany within the wider framework of=
 a
      radical transformation in Europe. The creation of the European Union
      entails new challenges and opportunities for us all. Both our country=
's
      increasing integration and the completion of its national unity were =
bound
      to have repercussions on our constitutional law. The fact that only
      adjustments were necessary attests to the Basic Law's excellent quali=
ty as
      the foundation of our polity from its inception. Its liberal, democra=
tic,
      federal and welfare elements enabled our country to acquire economic
      prosperity and social security while maintaining internal stability. =
</i></p>
   =20
    <p><i>The constitution can only set the standards and provide a framewo=
rk
      of law and order. It cannot solve specific problems directly. If it i=
s not
      to be rendered insignificant it must remain committed to fundamental
      principles. </i></p>
   =20
    <p><i>The Basic Law has proved its worth. It is the most liberal
      constitution the Germans have ever had and has served as a model for =
many
      other democratic constitutions. We Germans have every reason to be pr=
oud
      of our Basic Law and to defend it to the best of our ability.</i> </p=
